# UpTheNum II
Play it here: https://fellotheus.github.io/UpTheNum/

An incremental game where the whole point of the game is just to make the number go up as much as possible.
The game is a sequel to UpTheNum, a short incremental game test that I made when I was much newer to coding in javascript

This game uses OmegaNum, a large number library made by Naruyoko and some others.
